 CHAPTER 3: INTERPERSONAL CONDUCT

3.1 GENERAL GUIDANCE

1. The Navy has historically relied upon custom and tradition to define the bounds of acceptable
personal relationships among its members and with those outside of the military. Midshipmen
will conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism in all interpersonal interactions in all
settings and at all times. Midshipmen will treat each and ever y person with dignity and respect.

2. When in doubt, a midshipman should consult their chain of command, a chaplain, or a trusted
mentor for further guidance on acceptable interpersonal interactions.

3.2 HAZING

1. Hazing is a form of harassment that includes conduct through which Service Members or
DoD employees, without a proper military or other governmental purpose but with a nexus to
military Service, physically or ps ychologically injure or create a risk of physical or ps ychological
injury to Service Members for the purpose of: initiation into, admission into, affiliation with,
change in status or position within or continued membership in any military or DoD civilian
organization. Hazing can be conducted through the use of electronic devices or communications
and by other means including social media, as well as in person. Soliciting or coercing another
to perpetrate any such activity is also considered hazing. Hazing need not involve physical
contact among or between military members; it can be verbal or ps ychological in nature. Actual
or implied consent to acts of hazing does not eliminate the culpability of the perpetrator. Hazing,
in any form, is prohibited and will not be tolerated.

2. Regulations regarding hazing:

 a. No midshipman may engage in hazing or consent to acts of hazing being committed upon
them. An upperclass asking a Midshipmen 4/C if a certain hazing activity is ok, and that 4/C
saying ok does not mean the act is permitted. Hazing is hazing based on activity, not based on
consent.

 b. No midshipman, regardless of billet or rank, may condone or ignore hazing if they know
or reasonably should have known that hazing may or did occur. Every midshipman has the
responsibility to inform appropriate authorities (CO, SEL, or CMEO) of any hazing incidents or
potential hazing incidents.

c. Reprisal actions against any victim or witness of hazing incidents are strictly prohibited.

d. Physical abuse or harassment will not be tolerated in any form. Physical contact is
allowed with the 4/C only as necessar y for specifically approved training purposes, and with
prior consent from the individual being touched. No amount of physical force is condoned.

 e. Midshipmen in authority positions over other midshipmen will follow only practices that
would be reasonabl y and lawfully acceptable for use in the Fleet. All practices should be readily

 3-1
 6 Aug 2024

defendable with appropriate rationale to the parents of subordinates or other interested
constituencies.

3.3 DISCRIMINATION

1. Prohibited discrimination is discrimination, including disparate treatment, of an individual or
group on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender
identity or sexual orientation that is not otherwise authorized by law or regulation and detracts
from military readiness.

2. Regulations regarding discrimination:

a. Midshipmen will neither individually nor collectively discriminate against another
individual or group.

 b. Midshipmen will not take reprisal action against a person who provides information on an
incident of alleged unlawful discrimination. Reprisals are prohibited regardless of who
originates the reprisal action.

 c. Midshipmen will not knowingl y make a false accusation of unlawful discrimination.

 d. Midshipmen will not condone or ignore discrimination and are encouraged to report any
suspected discrimination to their CO, SEL, or CMEO.

3.4 SEXUAL HARASSMENT

1. Sexual harassment is a form o f sex discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

a. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or conditio n of a
persons job, pay, or career. For midshipmen, this could mean a term or condition of privileges,
selection for billets or training opportunities, or for service assignment preference.

 b. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonabl y interfering with an individual's
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. At USNA,
the working environment refers to every location on and off the Yard, 24 hours a day.

2. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, passive or indirect actions that create a hostile work environment such as sexually
explicit posters, pictures, or screensavers, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature.

3. Regulations regarding sexual harassment:

 a. Midshipmen will not commit sexual harassment as defined above.

 3-2
 6 Aug 2024

 b. Midshipmen will not take reprisal action against a person who provides information on an
incident of alleged sexual harassment.

 c. Midshipmen will not knowingl y make a false accusation of sexual harassment.

 d. Midshipmen will not condone or ignore sexual harassment and are encouraged to report
any suspected sexual harassment to their CO, SEL, or CMEO.

3.5 FRATERNIZATION

1. Fraternization is a gender neutral concept used to identify personal relationships that do not
respect the bounds of acceptable senior-subordinate relationships. Although it is most
commonly applied to officer- enlisted relationships, fraternization also includes improper
relationships and social interactions between officer members as well as between enlisted
members, regardless of the service affiliation of the other officer or enlisted member, including
members of foreign military services.

2. Circumstances prejudicial to good order and discipline are those that call into question a
seniors objectivity, result in actual or apparent preferential treatment, undermine the authorit y of
a senior, or compromise the chain of command.

3. Midshipmen on summer training will adhere to the specific fraternization policies of their
assigned units in addition to all USNA policies.

4. Collective terms associated with fraternization apply equally to personnel of foreign military
services.

3.6 UPPERCLASS 4/C RELATIONSHIP

1. Due to the unique training environment of the USNA and the essential leadership role
Upperclass Midshipmen hold in educating and training 4/C Midshipmen, Upperclass have a
senior-subordinate relationship with 4/C Midshipmen which must be respected and protected.

2. These regulations apply to all Upperclass-to-4/C Midshipmen. If there is clear and
convincing evidence of a pre-USNA relationship (where members of a pre-existing relationship
enter USNA in different years), the relatio nship will be permitted, but the current midshipman
must inform their chain of command prior to entry of the other member. The second incoming
midshipman will be placed in, and maintained in, the opposite regiment. The relationship in
Bancroft Hall must remain professional at all times and should not be readily apparent to other
members of the training environment.

3. Upperclass Midshipmen, including international exchange midshipmen, shall maintain a
proper professional relationship with 4/C at all tim es.

 3-3
 6 Aug 2024

4. Upperclass Midshipmen shall not:

 a. Attempt to personally degrade or humiliate 4/C Midshipmen.

 b. Date, have sexual relations, or otherwise fraternize with 4/C Midshipmen (unless they are
in an approved pre-USNA relationship per section 3.6.2 above).

 c. Request or direct 4/C Midshipmen to perform personal services, to include purchasing
supplies for Upperclass.

 d. Impose any informal or unauthorized punishment.

 e. Touch 4/C Midshipmen for any purpose other than correcting or adjusting a uniform, drill
or rifle position, or as necessary for other legitimate training or safety purposes. To the
maximum extent possible and prior to contact, the individual being touched should be informed
of the purpose and nature of the contact.

 f. Borrow anything from a 4/C Midshipman, including uniform items.

 g. Conduct activities with a 4/C before 0630 unless specificall y approved for training. 0535
or 0540 workouts must be approved as part of the training plan.

h. Direct a 4/C to write letters or send emails or messages as a prank.

 i. Enter a 4/C room during study period other than to provide academic assistance.

 j. Invite a 4/C to enter an Upperclass room.

k. Use an y real -time electronic communication with a 4/C unless for professional purposes,
e.g. Brigade recall. This includes, but is not limited to, instant messaging, chat rooms, social
networking sites, texting, or any comparable mode of communication. However, messages
between siblings or other close blood relatives (e.g., first cousins) regarding family matters shall
be considered a professional purpose when an in-person meeting is impractical.

3.7 MIDSHIPMAN USNA FACULTY/STAFF PERSONNEL RELATIONSHIPS

1. Unduly familiar personal relationships between midshipmen and active duty or civilian
facult y or staff members that do not respect differences in grade, rank, position of authority, or
the staff/student relationship, or are prejudicial to good order and discipline, are prohibited. This
prohibition includes interactions with enlisted personnel during training and leave periods away
from the USNA.

2. Midshipmen dealings with DoD police and Navy Security personnel shall be limited to:

 a. Promptly reporting any unlawful acts and acts that pose a physical danger to others. Acts

 3-4
 6 Aug 2024

of midshipmen that are prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and discipline should be
reported to the OOW.

 b. Reporting the presence of any unidentified person found in Bancroft Hall in areas under
the responsibility of a CMOD.

 c. Responding to questions or commands of USNA securit y personnel when those personnel
are in the performance of their assigned duties.

 d. Obeying lawful orders given by security personnel.

3. Midshipmen shall not employ the personal services of building attendants.

3.8 MIDSHIPMAN ENLISTED PERSONNEL RELATIONSHIPS

1. Personal relationships between midshipmen and enlisted members that are unduly familiar
because they do not respect differences in grade, rank, or position of authority, or because they
are prejudicial to good order and discipline, are prohibited.

 a. However, clear and convincing evidence of a pre-existing relationship prior to a change in
status of one of the members (e.g., E-4 subsequently becomes a midshipman) will make the
ongoing relationship permissible despite the status change, so long as the members disclose the
relationship to USNA prior to the change in status.

 b. The member who becomes a midshipman is required to disclose the relationship on I-Da y.
The relationship must be specificall y noted and approved by the Commandant of Midshipmen
and the relationship must be disclosed in Section F of the Marriage, Dependent, and Relationship
Declaration form prior to taking the Oath of Office on I-Day. Failure to knowingl y disclose any
pre-existing relationship after signing this document may result in conduct action.

 c. Midshipmen already at USNA and who are in a pre-existing (pre-USNA) relationship,
will, under this policy, be able to maintain said relationship. They must disclose their
relationship to their chain of command as soon as reasonabl y practicable. Per OPNAVINST
5370.2 (series), midshipmen who commission into the Navy will be able to maintain their
relationship through commissioning.

 d. Midshipmen who commission to the Marine Corps do not have a path to maintain enlisted
relationships. The Marine Corps only allows officer-enlisted relationships if marriage occurred
prior to commissioning (while both members were still enlisted), and as midshipmen are not
allowed to be married prior to commissioning, no officer-enlisted relationship would be
permitted. As such, midshipmen are not permitted to sustain relationships with enlisted Marines.

2. Midshipmen shall:

 a. Obey lawful orders given by enlisted personnel acting as instructors.

 3-5
 6 Aug 2024

 b. Maintain a proper professional relationship with enlisted members at all times, regardless
of duty station.

3. Other than relationships that began before arrival at USNA or before the Naval Academ y
Preparatory School and properl y disclosed midshipmen shall not date, have sexual relations, or
otherwise fraternize with enlisted personnel.

4. Midshipmen are expected to observe appropriate military courtesies with close blood relatives
(e.g., sibling, parent, grandparent, first cousin, aunt, or uncle) and continue to act in a manner
that respects differences in grade, rank, or position of authority while interacting or socializing
with close blood relatives.

5. Midshipmen may have enlisted members act as their sponsors via the Sponsor Program.

3.9 MIDSHIPMAN OFFICER RELATIONSHIPS

1. Personal relationships between midshipmen and officers that are undul y familiar because they
do not respect differences in grade, rank, or position of authority or because they are prejudicial
to good order and discipline, are prohibited.

2. Midshipmen shall not date, have sexual relations, or otherwise fraternize with commissioned
officers, with the following exception: 1/C and 2/C Midshipmen may maintain pre-existing
close personal relationships with newly commissioned officers provided the relationship was
initially established when both parties were midshipmen.

3.10 MIDSHIPMAN MIDSHIPMAN RELATIONSHIPS AND CONTACT

1. Unduly familiar personal relationships between midshipmen in the same Company are
prohibited when prejudicial to good order and discipline.

2. Any midshipman who desires to sustain a romantic relationship beyond a trial period with
another midshipman in the same Company shall request a transfer to another Company. For this
purpose, the trial period will allow two dates. A request to transfer must be submitted before a
third date or before sexual relations.

3. Displays of affection are prohibited while in uniform, regardless of location, and at all times
in Bancroft Hall and on the Yard. Displays of affection are defined as ph ysical acts which could
reasonabl y be interpreted by an observer as evidence that those participating are involved in a
romantic relationship. Displays of affection that midshipmen shall not do include, but are not
limited to, hand holding, touching, massaging/back rubs, sitting on a lap, touching, and kissing.
Displays of affection are gender neutral and considered equally inappropriate regardless of
gender.

4. Sexual activity in an unauthorized location includes, but is not limited to, fondling, displays
of affection on a rack, l ying in a rack together, oral sex, and sexual intercourse on the Yard and
aboard naval vessels.

patrol, leaving a note for a friend, etc.)

 (2) Onl y two people are in a room and one of them is not an assigned occupant

 (3) Any assigned occupant present does not agree to having the door closed. Non-assigned
occupants must leave the room at the request of an assigned occupant. The assigned occupant
may make this request for an y reason (e.g., assigned member needs to change, take a shower,
needs space, etc.).

 (4) Any upperclass is in any 4/C room.

are not bound by it.

b. Responsibility for properly documented (hardcopy or electronic) OCONUS travel
requirements that results in approved travel for personal leave rests solely with the midshipman who
desires to travel.Many of the required processes take time to review and submit, and if those

on travel already). This section does not apply to International Programs sanctioned travel.

Officer to Superintendent). This means that, once the DoD requirements are met for the desired
destination, the midshipmen will be permitted to go. Midshipmen should not buy tickets or commit
money to travel until their OCONUS trip is enabled, and this should be achieved by a standard
special request chit and may be submitted as early as they would like.

 (2). Approved indicates completing the USNA OCONUS Leave Travel Checklist
requirementsand obtaining the applicable explicit approvals . These can work in parallel with step
one, but travel is not approved until step two is complete. Completion is 100% the responsibility of
the traveling MIDN. If they do not begin the process early enough and do not achieve approved
status, they will not b e permitted to travel and USNA will not be responsible for their loss of money.

 APPENDIX C

 SPECIAL REQUEST FOR BODY ALTERATION (MIDSHIPMAN)

1. I, , Alpha ,
Company have read USNAINST 6240.10F and understand the U.S. Naval Academ y
policy regarding body alterations are as follows:

 a. Tattoos and Body Art. Four criteria will be used to determine whether tattoos/body
art/brands are permitted for Midshipmen and M/C: content, location, size, and cosmetic. Failure
to comply with established acceptable tattoo criteria as stated, is a violation of midshipmen
regulations and may subject me to disciplinary action to include involuntary separation.

 (1) Content. Tattoos located anywhere on the body that are prejudicial to good order,
discipline, morale or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the naval service are prohibited. For
example, tattoos that are obscene, sexually explicit, or advocate discrimination based on sex,
race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin are prohibited. In addition, tattoos that symbolize
affiliation with gangs, supremacist or extremist groups, or advocate illegal drug use are
prohibited. Waivers will not be granted for tattoos with prohibited content.

 (2) Location. No tattoos are permitted on the head, face (to include ear), neck, and scalp.
Permissible tattoos on the torso area of the body shall not be visible through white uniform
clothing. Chest tattoos will not be visible when v-neck undergarments are worn underneath any
uniform.

(3) Size. Leg and arm tattoos can be of an y size.

(4) Cosmetic Tattoos. Cosmetic tattoos are authorized to correct medical conditions
requiring such treatment. For purposes of this regulation, cosmetic tattooing refers to medical or
surgical procedures conducted by a licensed, qualified medical professional.

 b. Mutilation. Intentional mutilation of any part of the body is prohibited. Mutilation is
defined as the intentional, radical alteration of the body, head, face, or skin for the purpose of, or
resulting in, an abnormal appearance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

 (1) Split, forked, or pierced tongue;

 (2) Pierced nose, lip, eyebrow, or other areas of the face or body;

 (3) Foreign objects affixed to or inserted under the skin to create a design or pattern;

 (4) Enlarged or stretched holes in ears (other than normal piercing);

 (5) Intentional scarring on neck, face, scalp; or

 (6) Intentional burns creating a design or pattern. 
 6 Aug 2024

 c. Dental Ornamentation. The use of gold, platinum, or other veneers or caps for purposes of
dental ornamentation is prohibited. For purposes of this regulation, ornamentation is defined as
decorative veneers or caps. Teeth, whether natural, capped, or veneered, will not be ornamented
with designs, jewels, initials, etc.

2. Thoroughl y describe any desired alterations below. The written description shall accuratel y
describe the t ype, nature, location, and size of the proposed body alteration and translate any
foreign language or s ymbology contained in the proposed alteration, as applicable.

3. Upon completing the proposed body alteration, I will photograph and document the body
alteration with the Body Alteration Review Board. For the sake of modesty and privacy, onl y
close-up photographs of alterations normally covered by a regulation swimsuit shall be submitted
for review.

4. By signing below, I voluntarily agree to undergo all body alteration treatment or removal
required by the U.S. Naval Academy Body Alteration Review Board for alterations that do not
comply with U.S. Naval Academ y policy at my own expense. I understand that military
treatment facilities may not be able to provide treatment or removal services and I may have to
use a civilian facility at my own expense.

5. I enter into the agreement voluntarily, of m y own free will.

6. I understand the policies stated above, and I agree to not receive any body alteration without
prior permission from my chain of command after the signing of this statement. I understand
that deviation from USNAINST 6240.10F may result in conduct action against me or an order
for removal. I further understand that these guidelines are designed to keep me only within U.S.
Nav y standards.

7. Furthermore, I understand that the U.S. Marine Corps Tattoo policy as outlined in MCBul
1020 is more restrictive than the USNA policy and any desire to commission into the Marine
Corps requires compliance with MCBul 1020. Failure to comply with U.S. Marine Corps tattoo
policy may result in my inability to co mmission into the U.S. Marine Corps.
